		licenseType: 0, //0: for standard license, 1: for professional license, 2: for premium license
		company: "", //the company name you entered during license activation
		email: "", //the email you entered during license activation
		key: "" //you license activation key
	},
	function(message) { // Callback for successful opening.
		 console.log("Success: " + message);
	},
	function(err){ // Callback in case of error.
		console.log("Failure: " + err);
	});
```

```javascript
RadaeePDFPlugin.open(
	{
		url: "", //The path of the pdf to open
		password: "", //password if needed

	},
	function(message) {
		 console.log("Success: " + message);
	},
